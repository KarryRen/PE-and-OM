> 整体来说这门课包括以下几块的内容，每天按照进度不断往后推（一天看四个 PPT）



## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Definations

Platform brings together **different types of users** to enable economic or social interaction. A platform provides a way for two parties to enter into **mutually beneficial exchange or transaction**, platforms are matchmakers.

### 1.2 **Why are platforms taking over?** 

**Reason 1: network effects**

Platforms leverage network effects. Network effects mean that a user will pay more to connect to a larger network. Network effects create very significant inequality in sales and profits (**Winner-takes-most world**).

**Reason 2: Platforms usually have fewer employees and less fixed investment than traditional companies**

**Reason n: platform strength**

- **The focus is external**: A platform tries to bring together as many as possible from both (or all) sides, match them and create transactions. 
- Platforms disrupt traditional business

### 1.3 Role of platforms

**Four major roles of platforms:**

- **dealer**: buy from providers and resell to final consumers, brings together sellers and buyers and provides a substitute of directed trade (decentralized market). Uber, 滴滴, 高德, 亚马逊自营, Apple’s iTunes music store
- **pure platform operator**: provide platforms to allow sellers and buyers to interact. 购物网站, Airbnb, eBay, Amazon
- **infomediary**: an information gatekeeper which provides consumers with better information. 微博, 小红书
- **trusted third-party**: a certification agent which reveals product or reliability information. 支付宝, 安全认证

**How to set price ?**

A platform may collect from both sides (Airbnb)  or Collect from one side and subsidize the other (Amex). 定价的框架如下

### 1.4 Value of Platforms

**A simple model**

$v_H > c_H > v_L > c_L$ 的假设下画一个相交图，$v_L$ 和 $c_H$ 遇到后是无法交易的。Inefficiency comes from the matching friction (transaction cost)。对 Buyer 设定一个平台销售价格 $p_B$ 对 Seller 设定一个平台收购价格 $p_S$。将 $c_H$ 和 $v_L$ 赶出市场：$v_H - p_B \ge \frac{v_H - c_H}{2}$，$p_S - c_L \ge \frac{v_L - c_L}{2}$，同时又要保证 $p_B$ 尽可能高，$p_S$ 尽可能低，进而 $p_B = \frac{v_H + c_H}{2}$, $p_S = \frac{v_L + c_L}{2}$.  这样 $v_L$ 和 $c_H$ 都会推出市场，因为 $v_L-p_B<0$ 和 $p_S - c_H < 0$。这样只有 $v_H$ 和 $c_L$ 以及平台的交易中，达到了最优解，平台分利。

A platform that operates centralized exchanges may improve efficiency by sorting different types of participants.

**Further**

$v_H > v_L > c_H > c_L$ 本身就是最优均衡了，引入平台后 $v_L$ 和 $c_H$ 仍然会在平台下自由交易，这是和上面最大的区别，平台引入不会带来新的价值提升。

### 1.4 Dealer versus pure platform operators

**Model**

两种假设的模型推导下，得到的是相同的结果，profits 是 $\frac{1}{27}$。

Under our specification of uniform distribution, **a dealer platform and a pure platform operator obtain the same profits.** Moreover, the **optimal bid-ask spread (dealer) is equal to the transaction fee (pure platform operator)** and the trade volumes are the same.

但是这个结果并不是 General 的，是因为我们假设的均匀分布造成的。

**Conclusion**

哪种模式的利润或者销售量高是不确定的，平台可以根据自己的阶段转换角色

- If the platform acts as a dealer, trade is socially insufficient as the platform exerts monopoly power on both sides.
- If the platform acts as pure platform operator, sellers exert monopoly power over buyers, which yields high price but also high seller participation.
- In general, it is ambiguous under which role the platform makes higher profits and the transaction volumes are higher.

当然也有一些其他的因素导致 platform 选择的模式不同

- inventory **cost** of the platform,
- information **processing cost** of the platform,
- Information **asymmetry** between sellers and the platform



## 2. Network Effect

### 2.1 Introduction

**Network effects**, or network externalities are said to exist when the benefit that a consumer derives from owning a product increases when the number of other consumers of the product increases. 当拥有某种产品的其他消费者数量增加时，消费者从该产品中获得的效用也随之增加，也就是说个人获得的效用不仅取决于平台，还取决于使用平台的人数。

**Two types of network effects:**

- **Direct**: buyers form a network of users **who communicate with each other**. 我用了，会直接联系其他人一起用
  - Phones, Emails, Fax Machines, Operating Systems
  - DVD Players, Social Media, E-commerce and Games
- **Indirect**: the number of buyers of a good stimulates production of goods (supply side) that enhance the value of initial product. 买家多了 ⇒ 买家就会更多⇒ 买家获得更大效用
  - **Operating Systems:** more Windows users ⇒ more firms develop software ⇒ higher utility for Windows users. 
  - **Payment Cards:** 用的人多的话，Pos 机就多，用的人的效用就会很增加
  - **Shopping Malls**: more shoppers ⇒ more stores in the mall ⇒ higher utility to go there.
  - <font color="red">**Dating Agencies:** more males ⇒ higher male to female ratio ⇒ lower utility for males. (Negative)</font>

**Critical Mass**

The required network size for the network to take off. After reaching a certain scale, i.e. **critical mass**, the value offered by the network becomes really high for one or more user classes.

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/2.1.png" alt="2.1 " style="zoom:33%;" />

In practice, predicting the critical mass is very difficult:

- Diffusion within vs. across groups – targeting issue (不同的目标结果不同)
- Benefits from the size of the network – depends on product/service (不同内容效果不同)
- Competition from other networks/platforms – standard wars (竞争对手)

### 2.2 Demand Curve

和一般的需求函数可能只取决于所使用东西本身的质量不同，Network Effect 的需求曲线需要考虑使用的人数。How to create a demand curve when consumer WTP depends on how many people are using the product/service?

**Demand Curve without Network Effect**

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/2.2.png" alt="2.2" style="zoom:30%;" />

**Demand Curve with Network Effect**

核心在于对 Utility 方程的重新定义，过程再次不再说明，直接给出结果 $p=100f(1-f)$ 和后续分析：

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/2.3.png" alt="2.3 " style="zoom:40%;" />

There is always a Nash equilibrium, in which nobody purchases the fax machine.（所有人都不参与，本身就是一个 Nash 均衡）；

在 Price 不为 0 的情况下不可能所有人都参与进来，也就是说 $f \ != 1$。

Price 在 0 和 1 之间的时候有三个均衡点，两边的点是稳定的，中间的点不稳定很容易向左右两边滑落

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/2.4.png" alt="2.4 " style="zoom:30%;" />

关于均衡点 2：

- Given a price, marginal individual’s WTP is higher than the price when the network size is in between $f_- (p)$ and $f_+ (p)$
- Individuals whose WTP is above the price will purchase, which forces the network size to converge to the eq’m 3.
- Similarly, if the network size is lower than $f_- (p)$ or higher than $f_+ (p)$, marginal individual’s WTP is lower than the price, which discourage customers to purchase.
- Conversely**, the zero-demand and high-demand Nash equilibria are stable**: after a small perturbation (or even a large one, here), the industry goes back to the initial equilibrium.

上述分析可以得到 Critical Mass:

- Threshold $f_- (p)$ is usually thought of as the **critical mass** of buyers which leads to the buildup of the network.
- Once the monopoly has reached this critical mass, the snowball starts rolling (in the right direction), and consumers demand converges to the high-demand equilibrium $f_+ (p)$.
- Sometimes, it may take a lot of time to reach the critical mass. Example: Fax machines in the U.S.

Solve the Optimal Price:

$Π(f)=P(f)×(100f)=10^4 f^2 (1 -f).$

This yields a price $p=100×2/9=200/9$ and profits $Π=4×10^4/27$.

**Which Equilibrium to Reach?**

平台肯定希望到达均衡点 3，但是这取决于很多的因素，不一定是能够自然达到的。However, as a company, you can create an **external “shock**” to the system in order to shift from one equilibrium to another. 后面要多多讨论公司的策略。

Firm’s Strategies: (这些 Strategies 都是很 make sense 很容易被想到的)

- **Penetration pricing / introductory pricing**: Set a low price until you reach the critical mass. 
- **Price discrimination**: give away your products to some consumers (say, households), and make other consumers (say, businesses) pay. 
- **Pirated software.** 盗版软件
- **Government intervention** is necessary sometimes to rule out the zero-demand equilibrium.

After Reaching Critical Mass

Once we’ve reached a critical mass, we are in a good position. But we might also have to work hard to keep it. 

### 2.3 Path Dependence

**If there is a better product, it may not actually win**, especially if it’s a bit late getting started. The eventual outcome may depend crucially on a small number of initial adoptions. **History** can play a big role.

VHS 的胜利是网络效应主导标准战争的经典案例。Ohashi 的模型表明，尽管 Betamax 在非网络因素（如音质）上占优，但 VHS 通过内容生态、价格策略和开放合作，放大了网络效应的权重（*ω*），最终突破临界质量。这一案例揭示了平台经济中“连接价值”对“产品价值”的超越，并为现代技术标准竞争提供了理论参考。



## 3. Platform Pricing

### 3.1 Some Puzzles

A night club allows women to enter free. But it charges men entrance fee. Youtube allows us to visit and see its content for free. But advertisers need to pay. 还有一些其他的收费现象，引出来的是一种比较奇怪的定价结构 **Asymmetric prices structure**.

### 3.2 Standard monopoly pricing

$$
\max_𝑝⁡(𝑝 − 𝑐)𝐷(𝑝), \\
(𝑝^∗− 𝑐)𝐷^′ (𝑝^∗) + 𝐷(𝑝^∗) = 0, \\
𝑝^∗−𝑐=−\frac{(𝐷(𝑝))}{(𝐷^′ (𝑝))}
$$

最终可以求解出来 $p^*$ 相对于弹性 $\epsilon$ 的函数
$$
\frac{p^*-c}{p^*} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}
$$
这说明传统的垄断定价只和弹性与价格相关，与其他的特征都无关！

### 3.2 Platform pricing

**Two-sided monopoly: transaction fees**

所谓 transaction fee，含义就是每次交易都要向买卖双方收取的费用。在这个地方需要注意的是，买卖双方的需求函数和对方的 utility 是高度绑定的。最终针对 transaction fee 而言的求解结果如下：
$$
𝑡_𝑖^∗+𝑡_𝑗^∗− 𝑐 =(𝑡_𝑖^∗)/𝜖_𝑖 , ∀𝑖 = 𝐵, 𝑆 \text{ and } 𝑗≠𝑖
$$
where $ϵ_i=-t_i^∗ D_i^′ (t_i^∗)/D_i (t_i^∗) $ is the price elasticity of demand of side $i$. Define total fee by $t=t_S+t_B$ and total elasticity by $ϵ=ϵ_S+ϵ_B$. We are back to the Lerner formula:
$$
t-c=t_B/ϵ_B =t/ϵ
$$
这个结果和上面的标准垄断是一样的。

**Two-sided monopoly: registration fees**

所谓 registration fee，含义就是一次性收取的费用。同样效用函数也和对方的数量多少相关，最终可以求解最优 registration fee 如下：
$$
(𝑟_𝑖^∗−(𝑐_𝑖−𝛼_𝑗 𝐷_𝑗))/(𝑟_𝑖^∗ )=1/𝜖_𝑖
$$
这一部分的分析很重要：

- Registration fee decreases when the price elasticity increases. 弹性大就需要降低注册费
- If the number of users on side $j$ is large, platform tends to subsidize the side $i$. $D_j$ 大了 $r_i$ 就会小。
- Recall that $α_j$ represents how much value that side $i$ offers side $j$. In other words, it is the importance of the side $i$ in the perspective of side $j$.  **If side $i$ can offer more value to side $j$, platform tends to subsidize the side $i$.**
- Prices tend to be **lower** compared to the case where network externality is not present. ($α_j=0$) 
- Registration fees can be **below marginal cost or negative** if the cross-group network externality $α_j$, $D_j$ is large enough. 

**Different pricing strategies**

- In video games 用户弹性大, **end users are subsidized**. Platform providers like Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox price consoles at or below cost. Game developers pay a royalty to console manufacturers as much as 20% of a game retail price. 

  > Video game consoles users - typically teenagers - are **far more price sensitive than typical PC users**. 

  Making game consoles more affordable dramatically increased the value of console, shifting developer demand out and to the right. Here, game console subsidized consumers. **Profit lost on one side of market is less than profit gained on other side of market.** 补贴用户带来开发者的损失完全小于用户带来的收益。

- In the PC market 开发者弹性大, **end users are the money side**, paying well above cost. Application developers, on the other hand, pay no royalties and receive free software development kits from the OS vendors. 

  > PCs are often purchased for work and are otherwise more likely viewed as household necessities than game consoles are, so **price sensitivity** is lower. 

  Making System Development Toolkits (SDKs) free dramatically increased the value of operating systems, shifting consumer demand out and to the right. Here, Microsoft subsidized developers. **Profit lost on one side of market is less than profit gained on other side.** 补贴开发者带来的用户损失完全小于开发者带来的收益。

### 3.3 Divide-and-conquer 

**The launching stage**

Two-sided platforms often face a **“chicken-and-egg”** (**The Penguin Problem**) coordination problem（无法迈出第一步）:

- in order to attract buyers, the platform should have a large base of sellers, and vice versa.
- buyer are willing to join the platform only if they expect many sellers to join the platform too.

Problem arises when both sides hold pessimistic belief about the participation rate of the other side.

Possible solution: **Divide-and-conquer** (分而治之) pricing strategy: Subsidize one side of the market to get it on board and then use the presence of this subsidized side to attract the other side.

**Divide-and-conquer strategy**

For any $r_s>0$ and $r_B>0$ chosen in stage 1, sellers and buyers coordinate on the equilibrium which yields **the lowest payoff** to the platform. 

The detailed strategy: 分组后先用补贴吸引一部分弹性大的人，从另外一组人榨取更多资金

- divide group $i$: $r_i≤0$. (Subsidy side: attract users and grow network size)
- conquer group $j$: $r_j>0, j≠i$. (Money side: pay for the privilege of gaining access)

How it works ? 更难获取的一方被调动后，整个平台就活跃起来了

- Group $i$ gets surplus $-r_i≥0$ even no group $j$ agents join the platform. This is a **free meal** and they would like to join the platform.
- Given that group $i$ agents are on board, group $j$ agents would like to join if the $r_j$ is reasonable. The platform then charges $r_j>0$ to extract surplus from group j agents.

The coordination problem is more severe for those platforms at the launching stage: when a platform has established its reputation, the agents should not hold pessimistic belief about the other side’s participation.

**Demo: The Story of Acrobat Reader/Writer**

- Adobe Acrobat PDF reader is free while the Adobe Acrobat writer is not.
- Adobe first tried to sell PDF readers and writers but no one wanted to buy readers **when there was no content to read**. And, no one wanted to buy writers when no one had readers. Adobe broke the logjam by giving PDF readers away.

**Extension Thoughts**

In a traditional one-sided market, price depends only on **marginal cost** and **elasticity of demand**. 

But on platforms, pricing depends not only on the demand and cost from this side, but also on how their participation affects participation on the other side, and the profits associated with the other side, i.e., **the elasticity and the mark-up charged to the other side**. Identify the group that **creates large network effects** for the other group and the group that is more price-sensitive.

For a traditional one-sided market, we know that price should **drop when elasticity of demand is high**.

But in a two-sided market, you want to lower it even further. 

- The increased value extracted from the other side magnifies the value of having more consumers on the price elastic side.
- So often times, we see $p < mc$. 



## 4. Platform Competition

### 4.1 Standard competition models

**Bertrand competition**

Assumptions:

- 2 firms produce a homogeneous product (perfect substitutes) 很难完全同质
- Marginal cost = c for both firms 不同的公司边际成本一般不同
- Firms satisfy all the demand (i.e. there is no capacity constraints) 生产能力很难覆盖整个市场
- They **set prices** simultaneously (that is before observing the price of its rival) 现实可能有先后
- Consumers buy the product from the firm that offers the lowest price 有可能有偏向

The unique equilibrium is 
$$
p^*_i=p^*_j=c
$$
How to prove it? 在边际成本之上都可以降价，降价就可以增加利润，没有不降价的理由

Profit is 0? Why is it different from what we observe in the real life? 现实生活中很难满足如此多的假设，存在更多符合现实的情况

**Hotelling model of competition**

Assumptions:

- “Linear city” is the interval $[0,1]$. Consumers are distributed uniformly along this interval.
- There are 2 firms, located at each extreme who sell the same good. The unique difference among firms is their location.
- $τ$ is the **transportation cost**. This cost is up to the consumer to pay. If a consumer is at a distance $x$ to one of the sellers, its transportation cost is $τx$ . This cost represents the value of time, gasoline, or adaptation to a product, etc.
- Firms **set prices** simultaneously.
- Consumers buy the product from the firm that offers the highest utility to them.
- Consumers have unit demands, they buy at most one unit of the good $\{0,1\}$.

这个地方推导的核心在于找到对于 2 firms 的无差异 $x^*$ 然后分别让两个 firms 的 value 最高，求导就可以求解了。
$$
𝑝_1^∗=𝑝_2^∗=𝑐+ 𝜏
$$
对  $τ$ 还做了进一步的解释：An increase in $τ$ implies more product differentiation. Therefore, firms compete less vigorously (set higher prices) and obtain higher profits.

If the firms can choose their own locations, which are optimal locations for them? 价格竞争下，企业通过靠近对手减少消费者的运输成本差异，从而弱化价格竞争压力。

### 4.2 Platform competition

Consider the situation where multiple platforms are competing for users.

- **single-homing 单栖**: a user only joins one platform. 用户或供应商**仅在一个平台上活动**，不参与其他竞争性平台。
- **multi-homing 多栖**: a user joins several platforms. 用户或供应商**同时在多个平台上活动**，根据需求切换平台。

Possible configurations of users in platform-competition models.

- Both sides are single-homing.
- One side is single homing while the other side is multi-homing.
- Both sides are multi-homing. 

**Platform competition: single-homing**

Assumptions:

- There are two horizontally differentiated platform, 1 and 2.
  - There is a Hotelling line with length of 1. 
  - Platform 1 and 2 are located at the two ends.
- There is a unit mass of buyers and a unit mass of sellers.
- Each buyer or seller can at most join one platform (both sides are single-homing).
- Hotelling differentiation:
  - Both sellers and buyers are uniformly distributed on the Hotelling line. 
  - Hotelling transportation cost parameter: $τ_S$ for sellers and $τ_B$ for buyers.

Solution: 

求导之后的均衡如下：
$$
𝐴_𝑆=𝑐_𝑆+𝜏_𝑆−(\frac{𝑏_𝐵}{𝜏_𝐵} )(𝑏_𝑆+𝐴_𝐵−𝑐_𝐵)\\
𝐴_𝐵=𝑐_𝐵+𝜏_𝐵−(\frac{𝑏_𝑆}{𝜏_𝑆} )(𝑏_𝐵+𝐴_𝑆−𝑐_𝑆)
$$
先对这个中间等式做解析：

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/4.1.png" alt="4.1 " style="zoom:50%;" />

- when network externality is absent, Hotelling model will give $A_S=c_S+τ_S$.
- In the two-sided market setting, the price is adjusted downward by the factor $\frac{𝑏_𝐵}{𝜏_𝐵}(𝑏_𝑆+𝐴_𝐵−𝑐_𝐵)$
- The term $b_S+A_B-c_B$ represents the external benefit that platform $i$ gets by attracting an additional buyer.
  - First, platform $i$ makes profits $A_B-c_B$ when there is one more buyer joins.
  - Second, $b_S$ reflects the additional surplus that platform $i$ can extract from sellers when it has an extra buyer.
- Moreover, this benefit is adjusted by $\frac{𝑏_𝐵}{𝜏_𝐵}$ as one additional seller attracts $\frac{𝑏_𝐵}{𝜏_𝐵}$ additional buyers.

最终结果如下：其中 $𝑏_𝐵$ 是 Seller 给 Buyer 的网络效应
$$
𝐴_𝑆=𝑐_𝑆+𝜏_𝑆−𝑏_𝐵 \\
𝐴_𝐵=𝑐_𝐵+𝜏_𝐵−𝑏_𝑆
$$

- The side of the market which exerts larger externality tends to be subsidized. 更容易造成 Network Effect 的应被补贴
- The side of the market with little horizontal differentiation tends to pay low membership fee. 差异性越小定价越低

**Platform competition: multi-homing**

Under multi-homing, is the competition more fierce or less fierce? 显然是更激烈了

Under multi-homing, is it more or less likely to lead to “winner-takes-all”? 降低赢者通吃的可能性

Does multi-homing, compared with single-homing, have higher market efficiency? 效率的确更高！

**Extension**

- Big or small platform is more likely to accept interoperability? Small
- Congestion: negative same-side network effect 负面的网络效应可能带来拥挤

Aibnb 是全连接更稳固，Uber 则是按照地域连接很容易被切断（中国出现了 Didi）



## 5. Platform Launch

**Strategies to Overcome the Chicken-or-Egg Dilemma**

在第 3 章中，我们初步认识了 Chicken-or-Egg Dilemma 也理解了如何用定价的方式来破解问题，现在我们做进一步的探讨。

### 5.1 Subsidize users

**Fixed subsidy:** per user. Hourly payment guarantees, fixed bonuses for signup, referral subsidy. 

**Variable subsidy:** per interaction. Bonus on the supply side, discount on the demand side. 

### 5.2 Increase (perceived) value to new user 重要！

- Create standalone value. 创造独一无二的价值 (Operation system, phone)
- Start in niche market. 开启细分市场 (Facebook, Uber)
- Fill in one side (Taskrabbit, Taobao Tmall)
- Simulate users (Airbnb, weibo)
- Build hype 大肆炒作宣传 (Twitter, weibo) 

### 5.3 Decrease user adoption cost 重要！

- Compatibility: new platform compatible with the old ones. (可兼容性)
  - Playstation 5, Microsoft Windows OS, Taobao and Alipay 
- Offer tools or training
  - Microsoft, Intel offer development classes and kits. Uber offers help in driver licensing process. 

### 5.3 Dynamics of staging: which side first?

**Value dynamics 价值是不同的**

- Onboard **first those** who are less sensitive to the existence of the other side: LinkedIn（领英，雇主明显更敏感）MeiTuan (美团，用户明显更敏感)
- Onboard **simultaneously** if there is a lot of overlap in two sides: Etsy
- Onboard simultaneously if there is no standalone value: Nasdaq in 1971

**Cost dynamics 成本是不同的**

- Onboard first those who have low ongoing cost of staying on the platform: Meituan (restaurant 有较低成本，因此先被上线



## 6. Online Reputation

### 6.1 Information Asymmetries

**Reasons**

**Interacting with strangers.** E-commerce precludes potential customers from **inspecting goods prior to purchase**.  Online sellers tend to be newer firms/individuals and may have **less brand or reputation** capital to signal quality. **Sellers** (transaction partners) vary in terms of Skill, Effort, Ethics. These factors can create **information asymmetries** between buyers and sellers not present in off-line purchases. 

**Information Asymmetries**

- Asymmetric information 
- Uncertainty (symmetric incomplete information) 

**Adverse Selection** 逆向选择质量差的

- Defination: hidden characteristics / critical **prior to transaction**. Is a market situation where buyers and sellers have different information, so that a participant might participate selectively in trades which benefit them the most, at the expense of the other trader. 
- Examples: Akerlof's market for lemons. Job market. Health insurance
- Possible solutions to adverse selection: Screening (充分调查市场). Signaling (发送信号)

**Moral Hazard** 在被保护下做出肆无忌惮的做法

- Definition: Moral hazard can arise in any bilateral transaction, where an agent has the opportunity to deviate from the promised course of action, but where the action he takes is **hidden** such that he **doesn’t bear the full (negative) consequences/risk** of the action that he takes. 
- Examples: A person hired by a company (雇员); Museums asking for donations (募捐); Bailing out companies (救助公司); Paid sick leaves; Health insurance (健康保险); Renting a costume.
- Possible solutions to moral hazard: Monitoring (做好监管); Performance-based pay (根据表现定价); Reputation system.

### 6.2 Offline reputation system

**Information**

- More information to consumers is almost **always better**: economists and policy markers normally support policies to make more info available.
- In addition, when information is provided by firms it might affect their behavior as well. 

**Data**

In December 1997 LA County passed an ordinance requiring restaurants to display rating cards. 餐厅评级体系

- Demand at good places should go up or down? **UP**
- Demand at bad places should go up or down? **DOWN**
- Restaurants themselves might increase or decrease quality? (if the benefit exceeds the costs) **YES**
- Ratings reduce search costs for consumers. Competition will go up or down? **UP**

### 6.3 Online reputation system

Online reputation systems are online mechanisms that aggregate feedback from users past experiences, to enable **more informed decisions** of other users in the future. 

**Impact of Reputation Systems** 

- 增加价值：One study found that eBay buyers are willing to pay an 8% premium for buying from a seller who has 2,000 positive feedbacks and 1 negative feedback, compared to a seller with 10 positive feedbacks and no negatives. 
- 造成不信任：In another study, the researchers found that upon receiving his first negative rating, a seller’s weekly sales drop significantly, but that subsequent negative feedback has a much smaller effect. 
- 清理市场：The studies have also found that sellers are more likely to exit the market, the lower their reputation is. 

**Why Do Consumers Read Reviews?**

The main reasons given for accessing reviews are: 

- to ensure the product or service is **of good quality** (79%) 
- that the **product works** (61%) 
- to make sure they **don't get ripped off** (53%) 

**Why Do Consumers Write Reviews?** 

Motivations to post online reviews, are: 

- help others make **better purchasing decisions** (62%) 
- it is polite to leave feedback (35%) 
- want to share positive experiences (27%) 
- to help good vendors get business (25%) 

**Do Consumers Trust Reviews?** 

- Most consumers find reviews trustworthy, but only **13%** believe they are "very trustworthy" and a full **90%** believe that some people review products and services without trying them. 
- YouGov survey found that 21% of consumers have written reviews for products/services **they had never actually tried**. 
- A similar proportion (91%) believe companies write their own **positive reviews** and 89% think businesses **write negative reviews** about their competitors. 恶意抹黑

**Brand Reviews Across Industries**

The importance of reviews and advocacy is evident in every industry. 

- Online reviews are especially important for the **hotel/travel industry,** where over 80% of consumers find user reviews important. 酒店旅游业更重要
- Positive advocacy tends to be higher in industries whose products or services evoke consumers’ greater emotional involvement, such as smartphones, or in aspirational categories such as luxury cars. 能引起共鸣的行业中积极推荐比较普遍
- nIn contrast, negative advocacy tends to be much higher in service businesses, such as retail banking and mobile telecommunications: the reason is that any consumer facing interaction might lead to a negative experience, whereas a good product will usually remain satisfying. 服务业中消极的推荐则更为普遍

### 6.4 Reputation Systems 

The reputation-system introduces **intertemporal considerations**. Reputation causes people to take into account potential obstructions to their future trading-activity that are caused by receiving a bad reputation from malevolent behavior today. 

Reputation systems **alleviate the risk of observing morally hazardous behavior** by market-participants and, therefore, induces honest and trustworthy behavior. 

The reputation-system allows to clearly **distinguish benevolent sellers from malevolent ones**, reducing the potential for adverse selection. 

**Adverse Selection & Reputation Systems**

Reputation systems can be used to s**olve the adverse selection** problem by using **signaling mechanisms**. 

Remember that the goal is for the buyers to know the true quality of the goods that are in the market. 

Other users who have already bought the product have received a private signal about the products quality, i.e., they had the **chance to experience it and evaluate it**, and thus now have a better-informed belief about the products true quality.

By eliciting feedback from these users and sharing it with the community, the adverse selection problem can be addressed. 

**Moral Hazard & Reputation Systems**

Reputation systems can be used to address the moral hazard problem by using a **sanctioning mechanism**. 裁决机制

The idea is to sanction bad behavior by actors in the market. 

The reputation system can publish the history of actions of all agents, and can adopt the norm not to buy from agents who have repeatedly displayed bad behavior, or only at discounted prices. 拒绝与多次表现很差的人做交易

If the expected future losses from having a bad reputation is larger than the gains from cheating a few times, this provides the agents with an incentive to cooperate instead of to cheat. 利益受损大于短期获利那么就会注重 reputation 而作出正确选择

**Reputation Systems: Different Functions**

Depending on the particular domain, reputation systems can fulfill many different functions, including: 

- Trust-building: Reputation systems can encourage “good” behaviors and discourage “bad” behaviors. 
- Matching: Reputation systems can help to aggregate the most salient (重要) information about each product, making the selection easier for the users. 
- Promote quality
- Sustain loyalty (保持忠诚): Once a person or a product has a gained a particular reputation in one system, it is not easy to transfer or switch to another system. 

**A Simple Model of A Reputation System** 

<img src="./Final-Review-Note.assets/4.3.png" alt="4.3" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **Proposition:** In the group prisoner’s dilemma game with n agents, it is a Nash equilibrium for all players to play the grim-trigger strategy, for $δ ≥ 1/2$. 一旦贴现率大于 1/2 那么整个系统都会选择合谋 C 不会有人 D
- **Proof:** Assume that all agents except for one play the reputational-grim-trigger strategy. The agent considering the deviation faces the following decision problem: if he deviates once, all other agents will play D against him in all future founds. Thus, the analysis is the same as in the 2-player prisoner dilemma game above, which shows that for δ ≥ 1/2 , the agent is best-off to cooperate. 
- **Lesson:** There is strategic element in reputation building. To succeed, a reputation system should render cooperation (good behaviour) a dominant strategy. 

### 6.5 Methods to measure causal effect of online reviews

<font color="red">**已经搭建起 Reputation System 后开始考虑如何对这个系统做研究，真的有效果吗？**</font>

**Cross-sectional inference**

To measure the impact of online reviews ondemand of product $j$, if we run the following regression:
$$
\text{Demand}_j = \alpha + \beta* \text{Review}_j + \epsilon_j
$$
这种回归方式难以估计出准确的因果关系，因为内生性的存在 $\epsilon_j$ 和 $\text{Review}_j$ 并不是独立不相关的，因此 $\beta$ 大概率被高估。

**Panel data inference**

不同的时间可能有不固定的因果？那可以获取面板数据回归。When firms have data on demand and online reviews for various products over time, an approach that deals with some of the problem is one that **relies on panel data with fixed effects** at the level of the cross-sectional unit.
$$
\text{Demand}_{tj} = \alpha_t + \beta * \text{Review}_{jt} + \epsilon_{jt}
$$
**A/B tests**

当然这还是很有可能有内生性，那我们还可以仿照自然情况直接做实验。Randomly leave for a subset of products and then compare sales of these products with the sales of products which they did not leave review. 然后针对实验结果跑回归。
$$
\text{Demand}_{j} = \alpha + \beta * \text{Review}_{j} + \epsilon_{j}
$$
<font color="red">**更为细致的回归方法**</font>

**Natural experiments 自然实验是自然发生的政策或其他事件导致的数据差异**

Natural experiments rely on historical data that contain events that affect online reviews but are otherwise unrelated to demand. The purpose is to find the **exogeneous shock**. Difference-in-difference: comparisons of outcomes **shortly before and shortly afte**r the natural experiment.

> **Example:** Study the impact of user-generated microblogging content on the viewership of Chinese TV shows. 看微博评论对电视收视率的影响，发现其中有一段时间 WeiBo 突然被 Shut Down 了，正好是一次自然 (During the time period covered by the data, Sina Weibo was **unexpectedly** shut down for a brief period of time. The shutdown qualifies as a natural experiment)，做 DID 检验效果即可。

Other natural experiments:

- Merger of two review platforms (Lewis and Zervas, 2016).
- Change of methods to present the ratings. 
- Change of algorithms to calculate the scores. 

Limitation

- Hard to find, not standardized. (自然实验还是很少)
- Often yield context-specific estimates 
- Firms or individuals may anticipate the natural experiments and strategically adjust their behavior

**A/B tests 人为做实验修改变量验证效果**

Use information on any activity a firm might be able to leverage to **foster online reviews among its users**. **Indirect** manipulation of online reviews (操控 review 做到 A/B Tests). **Peer encouragement.** E.g., a targeted advertising campaign to users that provided positive reviews in the past.

> **Exapmle:** Eckles et al. (2016) randomly alters the Facebook interface of some users such that they become more likely to provide feedback (e.g., likes) to other users in their network. They then study the impact of the altered feedback behavior of the affected users on the behavior of their peers. 最后发现修改界面的人的朋友点赞数量也增加，这表明社交反馈具有传染性。

Advantages: Scalable; Downside: Hard to find interventions that affect online reviews without also directly affecting demand.

**Regression Discontinuity 断点回归**

Platforms have two scores: the underlying **continuous score** and a **star rating** (rounded to the nearest half star). Some platforms only present to consumers the rounded star rating (or only make it prominent). The rounding generates a **discontinuous jump** in the perceived rating (因为取整导致了跳跃) .Those products near the rounding threshold are likely to be similar except for their rounded star ratings. Hence, the causal impact of the star ratings can be obtained by comparing demand for products **marginally above and marginally below** the rounding threshold. 

Advantage: Scalable; Limitation: Only applicable to platforms which round the star ratings; Only suitable for analysis of valence, not number or content of reviews.

<font color="red">**目前已经被证实的一些结果**</font>

**Review Valence (评论等级)**: Average ratings are most studied aspect of the online reviews. Research find that they have a substantial causal impact on demand, though the magnitude of this effect varies by timing and context. 

**Review volume (评论量)**: are typically displayed prominently next to average ratings, and consumers can also use them to infer quality. Increases in review volume could lead to increased demand.

**Review Content (评论内容)**: is inherently high dimensional. Most analyses of review text rely on a pre-processing step that transforms text into a small number of variables.

> Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011) study the text of travel reviews and find that objectivity and readability are **correlated with higher product sales.** 
>
> Ludwig et al. (2013) show that positive and negative affective content (e.g., words such as “love” and “hate,” which are detected using LIWC) are **positively associated** with conversion rates. 
>
> Packard and Berger (2017) find explicit endorsements (“I recommended this book”) are **more persuasive than implicit endorsements** (“I enjoyed this book”). 
>
> Kupor et al. (2017) find product endorsements that contain **typographical errors** are perceived as more authentic, thus enhancing their persuasiveness. (有排版错误的评论更有说服力)

**Moderators of the relationship between reviews and demand (存在修正)**: Impact of reviews depends on consumers’ prior information. Reviews are not the only information source available to consumers, and thus they affect demand only to the extent that they provide new information. 影响主要来自于新增的信息

> 对于品牌连锁店，评论造成的影响很小，因为从评论中能获得的额外信息不多。Luca (2016) finds that Yelp ratings **do not impact the revenue of chain restaurants**. Lewis and Zervas (2016) show the impact of TripAdvisor ratings is much **smaller for chain-affiliated hotels** than for independently operated properties. 

**Timing**: Babic et al. (2016) show that **early reviews are more important** than recent reviews in driving the sales of new products.  

**黑红也是红**: Review platforms can help consumers discover new products and services they were not aware of. Berger et al. (2010) show that even negative reviews can have a positive impact on demand when they cause a sufficient increase in consumer awareness.

**Effect of online reviews on pricing and advertising**: Houser and Wooders (2006) find that on eBay, seller’s reputation has an economically and statistically **significant effect** on price; Lewis and Zervas (2016) use TripAdvisor data to show that hotel prices **increase** in response to online ratings; Hollenbeck et. al (2019) find that on TripAdvisor, hotels with higher ratings **spend less** on advertising than hotels with lower ratings. 

### 6.6 Design of online reputation system

<font color="red">**一个现实中的 online reputation system 该如何设计？**</font>

How Should An Ideal Reputation System Work? It should yield:

- High correlation between “reputation scores” and “true scores”.
- Or high correlation between “reputation scores” and future seller behavior.
- The system should be manipulation-proof towards any kind of malevolent action. (不会有任何的恶意操控)
- The system should measure and reliably display the trustworthiness of market-participants. (能够可靠显示市场参与度)

**细节决定**: In the real-world, the design of reputation systems must take into account many **different aspects of the particular domain**, and the devil is often in the details. Over the last few years, a group of market design researchers have studied the reputation system in detail, run experiments, ultimately changed the design, and studied the consequences of their change. 

<font color="red">**一个现实中的 online reputation system 该如何设计？**</font>

**What information to present?**

- Which actions are most relevant to the reputation system’s users?
  - To decide whether a seller is **honest**
  - To help users determine whether a reviewer has **similar tastes** to their own
- Which behaviors are desirable?
  - Want more posts or higher quality of reviews
- For which behaviors can one obtain reliable information?
  - First hand (internally generated) vs second hand (from others) feedback

**How to Aggregate and Display?**

- The extent to which the reputation mechanism **makes a judgment** versus allowing users to **make their own judgments**.
- The extent to which the presence of the reputation system can create **competition** among users.

*Way 1.* Raw activity statistics. E.g., # reviews posted, # transactions completed

- Most neutral method, 这是最中立的方法, 既有优势又有劣势
- Advantage: allows users to draw their own conclusions
- Disadvantage: users must be familiar enough with the environment to draw the proper conclusions. 

*Way 2.* Scores and distinctions. E.g. star ratings, numerical scores, levels, achievement

- Advantage: directly communicate to users whether somebody’s performance is good or bad
- Attention: Best in settings where there is a commonly agreed upon notion of what “quality” means. 

*Way 3.* Leaderboards and relative rankings

- Advantage: Increases incentives to contribute 
- Disadvantage: Instills a culture of competition (might be disruptive). Manipulative; Churn 

*Way 4.* Display a user’s entire history vs. recent behavior only. 

- Displaying entire history. 
  - Pros: helps build loyalty; 
  - Cons: not good for incentivizing continued contribution for seasoned users, and discourage new members from joining.
- Displaying recent behavior. 
  - Pros: gives newcomers equal opportunities; 
  - Cons: reduce the cost of moving to a competitor’s website

<font color="red">**Common problems and solutions**</font>

**Not enough reviews**

While most people read reviews to inform a purchase, only **a small fraction** write reviews on any platform they use. Strong network effect makes it worse. Solutions:

- **Seeding reviews 找代写的人**: hiring reviewers or drawing in reviews from other platforms. **Pros**: useful in the early stages; **Cons**: costly; differ from organically generated content.
- **Offering incentives 给激励**: motivate (financially or non-financially) your platform’s users to contribute reviews and ratings. **Pros**: simple and direct. **Cons**: costly for a large product array. could backfire (可能会适得其反).
- **Pooling products 一评多用**: by reconsidering the unit of review, you can make a single comment apply to multiple products. **Pros**: useful as your product space broadens. **Cons**: may fail to give your customers the information they need about any particular offering.

**Selection bias**

Research finds that consumers tend to leave a review only when their experience is **very good or very bad.** **Selection bias**: might not accurately represent the full range of customers’ experiences of the product. 只有非常好和非常坏的评论，因为只有感受很好或很坏的人才会有动力评论。

Example: eBay’s inflated online ratings in 2011. Thus eBay reformulated seller scores as **the percentage of all of a seller’s transactions** **that generated positive ratings** (instead of the percentage of positive ratings, why? 只有真正交易的人才能评论). 

Solutions:

- **Require reviews 强制评论**: requires users to review a purchase before making another one. **Pros:** simple; **Cons:** consumer churn 用户流失; noninformative review by using the default review.
- **Allow private comments 私下评论**: allow users to leave feedback that only the transaction partner could see.
- **Design prompts carefully 尽可能为评论者思考, 让其更好评论:** thoughtfully design different aspects of the environment in which users decide whether to review. 在写评论的时候不同的提示词下, 用户撰写的评论长度可能就有影响

**Whitewashing** 

An agent simply exits the system once he has a bad reputation, creates a new identity, and starts with a blank slate. This is particularly **easy** in many online domains where users only have pseudonyms, and thus nothing prevents them from whitewashing. Whitewashing can render the grim-trigger strategy ineffective! 毫无成本的洗白让犯罪风险很低, 评分无用

Solutions:

- **Require unique identities.** Cons: would severely limit registration numbers.
- **Require an initiation fee upon entry.** If the fee is chosen to be large enough, compared to the payoff the user receives from defecting and running down his reputation profile. 让注册费有威慑效果
- **Force new player to “pay their dues”.** The idea is to favor agents that have been in the system longer, or equivalently, to punish newcomers a little bit. 待的时间越长相对优惠越大

**Fraudulent Reviews**

Sellers sometimes try (unethically) to boost their ratings by leaving positive reviews for themselves or negative ones for their competitors. 很多商家会对自己的产品进行虚假评论从而引流。

Solutions:

- **Set rules for reviewers 设定规则:** decide who can review and whose reviews to highlight. **Cons:** may reduce the number of genuine reviews and reviewers. 可能就会减少数量了
- **Call in the moderators :** moderation can eliminate misleading reviews on the basis of their content. 请人帮忙做调整 (Employee, Community, Algorithm).

**Reciprocity**

Studies found a high degree of **reciprocity** between feedback from two traders involved in the same transaction. **Reciprocity（互惠性）** 指用户之间因相互评价行为而产生的策略性互动倾向，即一方对另一方的评价可能引发对方的对等或反向回应。这种行为可能表现为正向的“礼尚往来”（如积极评价引发更多积极评价），也可能表现为负向的“报复性反馈”（如差评引发更极端的负面回应）.

**Solutions - Simultaneous reveal:** feedback is only made public either after both traders have submitted their feedback, or after a fixed number of days has expired such that no more feedback giving is possible. 

- Pros: removes the possibility of conditioning the feedback on the feedback of the trading partner.
- Cons: might diminish the **frequency of feedback** giving overall, in particular, the mutually satisfactory feedback.

### 6.7 Firm strategies for Reputation System

<font color="red">**Trends and innovations 一些有关信誉系统的创新趋势应用**</font>

**Convenience** 追求更加便利

- **ultra-aggregation:** Sites which gather reviews on various businesses and/or industries. 将评论聚合起来方便查看
- **meta reviews:** Innovative tools offer companies to monitor reviews from **all over the web**, while providing **meta-data** which analyzes authentic reviews, for the end-user. 提供原数据 “Meta-Reviews are a trusted summary of relevant reviews worldwide, showing the most talked about and most relevant attributes of a particular hotel, along with some special, important-to- know ‘nuggets’ of information that are unique to the particular hotel.” 
- **search integration:** Shoppers usually use reviews as part of their shopping journey. So search engines strive to integrate reviews through the search engine.

**Personalization** 追求更加个性

- Amazon offers a “Shop With the Help of Your Friends” program. Users connect their Amazon account with their Facebook account to join. 社群化
- In 2012, TripAdvisor launched an app for Facebook, a way for hotel owners to pad their Facebook Pages with reviews, ratings, photos, and other content. 个性 APP

**Trust: everything is reviewable**

Grocery retailers and hypermarkets, are also incorporating online reviews, in order to drive sales and reduce online shopping barriers. 线下的平台也开始引入评分，目的就是搭建信任。

**Interaction: real-time feedback**

Mobile tools provide a way to post a review immediately upon receiving the service. 伴随体验及时回复

**Multi-channel, Multi-format**

Online reviews take many forms, and marketers should try and monitor those most important to their category. Review aggregators have evolved over the years: 起初只有评分，后续有了推荐甚至可以上传视频。

<font color="red">**Firm strategies**</font>

Today, companies acknowledge that shoppers share and read online reviews, and instead of viewing that fact as a threat, they try and turn it into an opportunity, by: 

- Hosting the reviews in their own websites
- Encouraging the user to a review aggregator for reading / writing a review
- Using positive reviews in their marketing communications (用评论做宣传)
